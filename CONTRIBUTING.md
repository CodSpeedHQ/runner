# Contributing to CodSpeed Runner

## Release Process

This repository is a Cargo workspace containing multiple crates. The release process differs depending on which crate you're releasing.

### Workspace Structure

- **`codspeed-runner`**: The main CLI binary (`codspeed`)
- **`memtrack`**: Memory tracking binary (`codspeed-memtrack`)
- **`exec-harness`**: Execution harness binary
- **`runner-shared`**: Shared library used by other crates

### Releasing Support Crates (memtrack, exec-harness, runner-shared)

For any crate other than the main runner:

```bash
cargo release -p <PACKAGE_NAME> --execute <VERSION_BUMP>
```

Where `<VERSION_BUMP>` is one of: `alpha`, `beta`, `patch`, `minor`, or `major`.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Release a new patch version of memtrack
cargo release -p memtrack --execute patch

# Release a beta version of exec-harness
cargo release -p exec-harness --execute beta
```

#### Post-Release: Update Version References

After releasing `memtrack` or `exec-harness`, you **must** update the version references in the runner code:

1. **For memtrack**: Update `MEMTRACK_CODSPEED_VERSION` in `src/executor/memory/executor.rs`:

   ```rust
   const MEMTRACK_CODSPEED_VERSION: &str = "X.Y.Z"; // Update to new version
   ```

2. **For exec-harness**: Update `EXEC_HARNESS_VERSION` in `src/exec/mod.rs`:
   ```rust
   const EXEC_HARNESS_VERSION: &str = "X.Y.Z"; // Update to new version
   ```

These constants are used by the runner to download and install the correct versions of the binaries from GitHub releases.

### Releasing the Main Runner

The main runner (`codspeed-runner`) should be released after ensuring all dependency versions are correct.

#### Pre-Release Check

**Verify binary version references**: Check that version constants in the runner code match the released versions:

- `MEMTRACK_CODSPEED_VERSION` in `src/executor/memory/executor.rs`
- `EXEC_HARNESS_VERSION` in `src/exec/mod.rs`

#### Release Command

```bash
cargo release --execute <VERSION_BUMP>
```

Where `<VERSION_BUMP>` is one of: `alpha`, `beta`, `patch`, `minor`, or `major`.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Release a new minor version
cargo release --execute minor

# Release a patch version
cargo release --execute patch

# Release a beta version
cargo release --execute beta
```

### Release Flow Details

When you run `cargo release --execute <version>`, the following happens:

1. **cargo-release** bumps the version, creates a commit and a git tag, then pushes them to GitHub
2. **GitHub Actions release workflow** triggers on the tag:
   - Custom `cargo-dist` job creates a draft GitHub release
   - `cargo-dist` builds artifacts for all platforms, uploads them to the draft release, and then publishes it
3. Only if it is a runner release:
   - Custom post announce job marks it as "latest" and triggers action repo workflow

This ensures only stable runner releases are marked as "latest" in GitHub.

## Known issue

- If one of the crates is currenlty in beta version, for example the runner is in beta version 4.4.2-beta.1, any alpha release will fail for the any crate, saying that only minor, major or patch releases is supported.
