## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> For now, the CLI only supports Ubuntu 20.04, 22.04, 24.04 and Debian 11, 12.

First, authenticate with your CodSpeed account:

```bash
codspeed auth login
```

Then, run benchmarks with the following command:

```bash
codspeed run <my-benchmark-command>

# Example, using https://github.com/CodSpeedHQ/codspeed-rust
codspeed run cargo codspeed run

# Example, using https://github.com/CodSpeedHQ/pytest-codspeed
codspeed run pytest ./tests --codspeed

# Example, using https://github.com/CodSpeedHQ/codspeed-node/tree/main/packages/vitest-plugin
codspeed run pnpm vitest bench
```

## Advanced usage

### Installing tools before running

You can install executors and instruments before running the benchmark with the `setup` command:

```bash
codspeed setup
```

This is especially useful when configuring environments with tools such as docker.

### Logging level

Use the `CODSPEED_LOG` environment variable to set the logging level:

```bash
CODSPEED_LOG=debug codspeed run ...
```
